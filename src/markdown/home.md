# Welcome!
## What is Indie Game Con?
It’s tricky to market a game with no budget, and it’s difficult to labor in solitude on a passion project. But when strangers pick up the controller and start to laugh and smile, it all seems worth it. And when you meet fellow creators who understand the highs and lows of indie game development, you feel like you’ve found your tribe.

That’s why Indie Game Con exists: to put creator-owned games in front of mainstream audiences, and build a space where game developers can hang out with their own.

IGC has been an annual event in Eugene, Oregon since 2013, and is run by Bitforest, a non-profit organization sponsored by Innovate Oregon. Run by volunteer tech and game dev professionals, it’s an expression of the inclusive game community in Eugene and beyond.
