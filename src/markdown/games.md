## Game Submission Guidelines
Thank you for your interest in submitting a game to Indie Game Con this winter. An Indie Game Con submission puts you in front of hundreds of passionate game developers and consumers. In previous years, we have had 400 individuals attend our event. Not only can you get live feedback for your game, it will give you a chance to meet with other game developers, and help continue Indie Game Con as an Oregon tradition.
