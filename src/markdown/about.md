## History

In October 2014, a small team of unpaid volunteers brought 18 Oregon video games, 7 industry speakers, and one amazing art show to a co-working space in downtown Eugene. We called it Indie Game Con, advertised the best we could, opened the doors… and promptly filled to capacity.1
Over 400 people from around the state came to play games, meet developers, and learn about an industry that’s not only growing, but brought more than $100 million dollars into Oregon as recently as 2012.2
A decade prior, the previous Indie Game Con had catered to independent game developers, who came from around the world to learn from experts.3 Now, game development in Eugene is growing at an accelerated pace4, and a global market has opened up to to independent developers, who sell their games online.
To keep up with these changes, Indie Game Con has been reborn as a consumer-focused event that celebrates game culture, puts Oregon-made products in front of buyers, opens the door to aspirational and educational opportunities for our youth, and provides expert-level speaking sessions that are open to everyone.

In 2015, we want to double the number of games, speakers, and art on display. We want to integrate local and state STEM / STEAM organizations. We want to broadcast the event on the internet. We want to capture the attention of national media. We want to do this because we believe Indie Game Con can make a huge, positive impact on our local economy, and grow our state’s game development community.

For that reason, we are asking for maximum support from Lane County, $10,000, so that we can catapult this semi-regional event into a Pacific Northwest icon, and effectively self-fund from that point on.

### WHO WE ARE
Indie Game Con 2014 was organized by a team of unpaid volunteers, in less than four months. The principals were:
- Ted Brown, Director. Owner and game developer at Oreganik LLC. Community Organizer for Eugene Area Game Developers.
- Michael Jones, Head of Industry Relations. Owner and sound designer at Dat's Some Good Sound LLC. Community Organizer for Eugene Area Game Developers.
- Will Bucknum, Head of Industry Talks. Owner and voice over producer at Voice to Game.
- Sarah Koski, Art Director. Board president of the Downtown Initiative for Visual Arts.
- Shaylor Murray, Media & Marketing. Owner of Limelight Productions.
- Aloma Loren Murray, Space Manager. Owner of Eugene Mindworks, our show space.

It must be said that, without the energetic game development communities in Eugene and Portland, Indie Game Con wouldn’t exist. So, for 2015, we have recruited:
Britt Brady, a leading local advocate for independent game development in Eugene
Will Lewis, the director of Portland Indie Game Squad

And we will continue to expand the roster by building on the success of 2014.

In 2015, our goal is to found a non-profit, tax-exempt organization called Bitforest, legitimizing our loose coalition of volunteers and partners in industry, education, and government. One of its tasks will be to take over Indie Game Con. Any money granted to Oreganik LLC for this event will promptly be transferred upon its instantiation.

### OUR PARTNERS
Our partners in 2014 were:
- Travel Lane County
- Lane Community College (Game Development)
- Intel
- HP
- RAIN
- Oregon Story Board
- Oreganik LLC (underwriter)
- Holiday Inn Express
- Vance Naegle

For 2015, we have officially secured support from:
- Travel Lane County
- Oregon Video Game Association
- Technology Association of Oregon
- Oregon Film
- Portland Indie Game Squad
- Pixel Arts Game Education

In early 2015, we are going to begin a drive for financial and in-kind sponsors. Early, unofficial response has been very positive. Our success this year hopefully planted some seeds that will bear fruit in the next.

Finally, we are elated to share that we have secured an event location at Lane Community College’s beautiful Downtown Campus!

### OUR FINANCES IN 2014
Indie Game Con 2014 was almost entirely underwritten by Oreganik LLC, with no guarantees of profit or break-even status. To maximize attendance, tickets were free if pre-ordered ($5 at the door for adults). There was no advertising budget: everything was word of mouth and social media.

We received $520 from sponsors, and our costs ended up at about $1,200. This included:
Travel and lodging for two of our speakers (our keynote speaker was from Seattle)
- Signage
- Press Release
- Handouts
- Flyers
- Official IGC Prints (which were sold for $5)
- Surge protectors
- Bottles of water for developers
- etc.

Our costs did not include:
- Paying for the space
- Paying for the time of our organizers (Ted Brown, the director, spent more than a full month working on the event with no pay. Many other organizers also worked several weeks without pay to make this happen.)
- Paying for advertising (minus a press release, we had none!)
- Paying for the website design and logo
- Paying for the promo video production (for the website)
- Numerous necessities (such as food for our developers on the show floor!) that would have been extremely helpful 


Thanks to extremely healthy attendance and our sponsors, our gross income for the event was $2,033.19. This allowed us to give token amounts to our volunteers.
- $50 for the main organizers
- $100 to our poster artist
- $150 to our promo videographer
- $300 to Eugene Mindworks, our show space

Our balance at the end of the day was $63.10, which was set aside for future needs.

### OUR FINANCES FOR 2015
We believe that strong support from Lane County for Indie Game Con 2015 will give us the opportunity to make a serious and lasting impact, and set us up to have following years sustained and supported by sponsors and ticket sales.

As we have no full-time staff dedicated to this event (we are all working!), our budget will not be as precise as others. However, here are our estimates, based on what we learned in 2014.

- Salary for staff organizers (distributed by time share): $5000
- Advertising in Eugene, Salem, Florence, Portland, Bend, and Medford: $3000
- Travel and lodging for speakers: $700
- Banners and Signage: $500
- Food and beverage for developers and speakers: $300
- Official poster prints: $200
- Lanyards & Badges: $200
- Internet advertising: $100

The total is $10,000. We are asking for your maximum support, because we believe the time is right to make this a permanent, annual event that remains in Eugene. While we love our fellow game developers in Portland, we do not want to see another Oregon fixture taken from us and travel north.

Without grant funding, the majority of our time will be spent trying to find other sources. As you know, “money follows money.” A grant by Lane County adds legitimacy and interest, and would make it easier to secure more funding… a self-sustaining cycle. Without that initial boost, it will be a hard road, and will potentially cripple the event (or, realistically, our sleeping schedules!).

We must emphasize that the number one question we received was “When is the next one?” This is was often followed by “I didn’t know they made games here!” The demand is here, and the time is now. These are exciting times!

### OUR TIMELINE
Indie Game Con 2014 happened in early October. We want to target the same timeframe, just after UO students come back to school. We are also working with Sol Joye at the University of Oregon to see if synchronizing with their planned Ed/Tech Conference will further boost attendance.

##### In January and February of 2015, we will be pursuing sponsors and partners for the event.

##### In March and April, we will be organizing Epic Oregon Game Jam, an open-invitation event (also at LCC’s downtown campus) that promotes game creation by students and independents. Indie Game Con 2015 will be announced there.

##### In May and June, we will:
- Lay down the information infrastructure for the event (websites, a mobile app, etc)
- Develop a marketing plan and prepare marketing materials
- Do one final round of seeking sponsors and partners
- Open up registration for developers and artists
- Open registration for vendors (we had no vendors last year: we think it would be good to give local game stores presence at the event)
- Ask for speakers to give submit proposals
- Design a loose floor plan

##### In July and August, we will:
- Order print materials
- Make advertising buys
- Actively seek developers, artists, vendors, speakers, and volunteers
- Finalize accommodations with LCC
- Finalize the floor plan and schedule

##### In September, we will shift into full-time staffing mode to ensure everything runs efficiently. Final print materials (ones that rely on a final list of developers and speakers) will be designed and printed. And, at the end of September or start of October, lots of people will travel to Eugene, a lot of coffee will be brewed, and Indie Game Con 2015 will run its course.

### OVERNIGHT STAYS
We recognize that this grant money comes from Transient Room Taxes. For us to make good on Lane County’s investment, we must reach out to consumers throughout Oregon, California, and Washington. That is our plan, should we receive funding.

We believe the overwhelming success of Indie Game Con 2014 -- which had no advertising -- bodes well for a larger event with advertising. It is also one of the few game industry events that is consumer focused. While we don’t want to compare ourselves with the Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle, it is a consumer event that brings 50,000 people every year. The demand is clearly there. We just need your help to get the word out, and support the people who make it happen.

Thank you for your time. Please contact us if you have any questions or concerns. 

Happy holidays!

### LETTERS OF SUPPORT
A few hours ago, I asked our community for letters of support. Here is what I received. I’m sure more will be coming in over the next few days!


I came to Oregon almost eight years ago to work for a game studio and I'm glad that I did. I love Oregon and Eugene. In that time I help build a local studio, that went on to be purchased by Disney and provided high paying jobs for close to fifty people in Eugene, and attracted top talent to relocate here from out of state. All of whom in turn contributed greatly to the local economy. 

Having worked on the industry for over twenty years, I can tell you that the game development community Eugene is a sleeping giant of potential economic growth. It is simply a matter of time before it wakes up to realize it's potential.

Please help us achieve that.

The Indie Game Convention in Eugene was one of the most import things that has happened to me as  a developer. It put me in connection with other developers on the west coast which has sewn a support network for me. It was the first time I had shown off a game to the public and it motivated me to do it more. I even have been approached by companies like Microsoft about my product from my participation. I have since began my own small company that I am building from the ground up. I hope to expand this company over the next few years here in Eugene and create a plethora of titles doing so. 

When I signed up for IGC last year i expected a small intimate event. My expectations where far exceeded. The event had only a couple months to my knowledge to be planned. The turn out was incredible and the attention we attracted outside of our network afterwards was amazing. The people organizing this event are truly professionals with a vision for success in Eugene.
